    - **Definitely yes**
12. Is there any information you expected to find on the dashboard that was missing?
    - **None**
13. What's one feature you liked most about the dashboard?
    - **I really like the various visualizations showcased in each tab.**
14. What's one feature you would change or improve?
    - **In tab 1, the filter options are overlapping, making it difficult to make a choice or navigate through the available options.
      - In tab 2, there are some technical music terms (used as a filtering variable) that we’re not familiar with. It would be nice to have a tooltip for these terms and provide a brief description of the different terms. Also, suggesting moving the filter option on top rather than making the user scroll all the way down.
      - In tab 3, we felt that it might be a bit difficult in choosing countries from the map, as there are many smaller countries which are harder to identify.**

### Received Feedback:

After reviewing the demographics of Spotify users, it is evident that they are enthusiastic about listening to music and keeping up-to-date with recent trends. They were able to sufficiently navigate the three tabs, rating the majority of the dashboard questions with a score of 4 or higher (ranked in order from lowest to highest, with 5 being the highest), however, only rated responsiveness in question 9 as neutral. This could be due to the size of the dataset being used, which was also discussed as a limitation in milestone 2 and will be addressed. Finally, question 14 included suggestions for improvement that related to each tab and are discussed further below.

1. **Tab 1**
   - Handle with the overflow string text of filters.

2. **Tab 2**
   - Add small "info" icons next to each technical term. When the user hovers over the icon, a concise definition of the term should appear.
   - Replace the headers with more self-explanatory text.
   - On the top of the tab, provide a short how-to guide for the user to get the most out of this page.

3. **Tab 3**
   - Provide a searchable list of countries in addition to the map view. Allowing users to switch between the two for ease of selection.
   - Add a brief description for the user on how to utilize the interactive elements.
